## Note

Some these files can be found in other Repositories but i converted them  into `.Js` so you can use them in th backends since they are written in Javascript.


**How to setup multiple gameservers**
1. - Go to Config/config.json in the directory you extracted Reload Backend into.
2. - Open it, you should see a "gameServerIP" section in the file.
3. - To add more gameservers you will have to do it like this

>***Example here:*** 
>
>- `"gameServerIP": ["127.0.0.1:7777:playlist_defaultsolo","127.0.0.1:7777:playlist_defaultduo"],` 
>
>  **OR** (for other backends) 
>- `"gameServerIP": ["Your-IP:MM-Port:Your-FN-Playlist-Id-here","Your-IP:MM-Port:Your-FN-Playlist-Id-here"],`


4. - You have now added solos and duos to your matchmaking.
